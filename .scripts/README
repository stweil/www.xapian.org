This directory will not be added to the website.

All other content in the website module will be added automatically.

This directory contains the script used to update the website: if this script
is modified, the modified version will be put in place by the next checkout,
and used for all following checkouts.

Currently you'll have to get Olly to run this script by hand if you make
changes to the website.
