<center><h1>History</h1></center>

The Xapian project is based upon the code of Omsee (also known as Open Muscat)
originally developed and released under the GPL by BrightStation PLC.
BrightStation is no longer trading, but some of the original developers
from BrightStation and others from the Omsee community decided to continue
development of the code.  Before the name Xapian was chosen, the project
was briefly known as Omseek.<p>

BrightStation's Omsee project was to be a replacement for their Muscat 3.6
library, which was originally written by Dr. Martin Porter at Cambridge
University.  In 1984, Martin and John Snyder founded Cambridge CD Publishing
to commercially exploit the technology; the company was soon renamed
Muscat Ltd when the focus shifted from CDs to the web.  Muscat Ltd was
bought by Maid PLC, who renamed themselves first to Dialog Corporation, and
then to BrightStation PLC.<p>

Omsee (using the muscat36 backend) was the retrieval engine which powered
BrightStation's Webtop search engine, which offered a search over around
500 million web pages (around 1.5 terrabytes of database files).  Searches
took less than a second.  The whole search engine, including the web crawlers
and index building, ran on 30 Intel boxes.<p>

Xapian is a modern class library, but has evolved out of over 20 years of
commercial and academic experience.
