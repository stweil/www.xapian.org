<h1>Bleeding Edge</h1>

<p>
If you want a stable version of Xapian, we recommend using a
<a href="download">released version</a>.  But if you're happy to cope
with potential breakage and want to try the latest development code, or
do development yourself, you can access our version control system.
We're in the process of migrating to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>,
but currently the master repo is hosted on
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">subversion</a>
(known as SVN for short), with a read-only git mirror.
</p>

<p>
The repository includes a complete history of the code, including that from the 
original Open Muscat project's CVS repository.  Additionally, we recreated copy 
and rename operations for historic commits (CVS doesn't support copy or rename 
directly).  We dropped CVS tags for the old nightly snapshots (and a few others 
which it seems highly unlikely anyone would find useful) - if you really need 
these for some reason, contact us for a copy of the archived CVS tree.
</p>

<h2>Access Details</h2>

<p>Note: If you just want to look at the history of a few files, you may find
it easier and quicker to browse the repository online:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://gitorious.org/xapian/xapian">browse git (using gitorious)</a>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/xapian/xapian">browse git (using github)</a>
<li> <a href="http://trac.xapian.org/browser">browse SVN (using trac)</a>
<!-- No longer works
<li> <a href="http://svn.xapian.org/">browse SVN (using viewvc)</a>
-->
</ul>

<h3 id="git">Using Git</h3>

<p>
Currently this is a read-only mirror of our SVN repo, which is updated 
automatically in response to commits to SVN, so should be at most a few minutes 
behind.
<p>

<p>
There are also mirrors on <a href="https://gitorious.org/xapian/xapian/">gitorious.org</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/xapian/xapian">github</a> which you will probably
find more convenient to clone from if you use those sites.  These are updated
by the same system which updates git.xapian.org, so should be very current.
There's also a git mirror on <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/xapian.git">repo.or.cz</a>
which updates by polling.
</p>

<p>
Check out like so (assuming you're using git.xapian.org):
</p>

<ol>
<li> <tt>git clone git://git.xapian.org/xapian</tt>

<li> Read the "Building from git" section in <a href="http://trac.xapian.org/export/HEAD/trunk/xapian-core/HACKING"><tt>xapian-core/HACKING</tt></a> - in particular make sure you have the required tools installed.

<li> In the newly created <tt>xapian</tt> directory, run the command
    <tt>./bootstrap</tt> - this will run various developer tools to produce a
    source tree like you'd get from unpacking release source tarballs.

<li> <tt>bootstrap</tt> will create a top level <tt>configure</tt> script,
    which you can use to configure the whole source tree together.

<li> If you're looking to do development work on Xapian, then the rest of
    <tt>xapian-core/HACKING</tt> is recommended reading.
</ol>

<p>
All branches should be available via git (you can list them with
<code>git branch -r</code>).  Note that SVN tags appears as branches in git.
</p>

<h3 id="svn">Using Subversion</h3>

<p>
We recommend using git now, as we're going to fully migrate away from SVN in 
the near future, but should you need to work with SVN in the meanwhile, here
are the details:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <tt>svn co svn://svn.xapian.org/xapian/trunk xapian</tt>

<li> Read the "Building from git" section in <a href="http://trac.xapian.org/export/HEAD/trunk/xapian-core/HACKING"><tt>xapian-core/HACKING</tt></a> - in particular make sure you have the required tools installed.

<li> In the newly created <tt>xapian</tt> directory, run the command
    <tt>./bootstrap</tt> - this will run various developer tools to produce a
    source tree like you'd get from unpacking release source tarballs.

<li> <tt>bootstrap</tt> will create a top level <tt>configure</tt> script,
    which you can use to configure the whole source tree together.

<li> If you're looking to do development work on Xapian, then the rest of
    <tt>xapian-core/HACKING</tt> is recommended reading.
</ol>

<h2>Write Access</h2>

<p>
We provide write access in one of two ways, either using WebDAV over https or
over ssh (generally you'll be given one sort of access <b>or</b> the other, not
both).  There's a section describing how to set up for each below.
</p>

<h3>WebDAV over https</h3>

<p>
If your username is <i>ian</i> then execute the following command:
</p>

<blockquote><tt>
svn --username ian ls https://svn-dav.xapian.org:8443/xapian/
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
The certificate we use for HTTPS is issued by <a href="http://www.cacert.org/"
>CAcert</a> so unless your operating system or subversion client is already 
configured to trust such certificates you will get the following warning:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
Error validating server certificate for 'https://svn-dav.xapian.org:8443':
 - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!
Certificate information:
 - Hostname: svn-dav.xapian.org
 - Valid: from Sat, 21 May 2011 03:37:43 GMT until Mon, 20 May 2013 03:37:43 GMT
 - Issuer: http://www.CAcert.org, CAcert Inc.
 - Fingerprint: 06:46:7a:a3:f6:11:2f:2a:41:63:e1:7e:e4:d3:07:15:4f:7d:4c:e6
(R)eject, accept (t)emporarily or accept (p)ermanently?
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Since this page isn't served via https, you should check the fingerprint is
<a href="http://survex.com/~olly/svn-dav.xapian.org-fingerprint.gpg">as in this version GPG signed by Olly Betts</a> (using the same
key which signs release announcements on the xapian-discuss list).
</p>

<p>
If the fingerprint doesn't match, or you have other concerns, talk to the other 
developers - don't just accept the certificate.  If you're happy with it, you
can either accept it temporarily (and be asked to confirm it for every
"session", though not every remote svn operation), or permanently.  We
recommend you accept it permanently (so press <i>p</i>) as otherwise you need 
to recheck the fingerprint repeatedly, which actually makes it more likely you 
might accidentally accept a spoofed certificate.
</p>

<p>
You'll then be asked for your password:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
Authentication realm: &lt;https://svn-dav.xapian.org:8443&gt; Xapian Subversion Repository
Password for 'ian':
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Assuming you type your password correctly, you should get a list of the top
level directories in the SVN tree:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
branches/
tags/
trunk/
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Your password <b>may</b> be cached in plaintext in your home directory -
you should ensure that it is being encrypted, or disable this caching.  See the 
relevant <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#plaintext-passwords">Subversion
FAQ entry</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
Now you can check out a tree with commit access like so:
</p>

<blockquote><tt>
svn co https://svn-dav.xapian.org:8443/xapian/trunk xapian
</tt></blockquote>

<h3>ssh</h3>

<p>
You will need to do a small amount of configuration as we use userv to provide
additional security.
</p>

<p>
For access on atreus itself, simply create a <tt>[tunnels]</tt> section in your
<tt>~/.subversion/config</tt> file, and add to it the line:
</p>

<blockquote><tt>
userv = userv xapian-svn svnserve
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
Then you can check out a tree with commit access like so:
</p>
       
<blockquote><tt>
svn co svn+userv:///xapian/trunk xapian
</tt></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
For remote access via ssh, again create a <tt>[tunnels]</tt> section in your
<b>local</b> <tt>~/.subversion/config</tt> file, but instead add this line:
</p>

<blockquote><tt>
ssh+userv=bash -c 'user=${0/@*};host=${0/$user@};ssh $host userv $user svnserve'
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
Then you can check out a tree with commit access like so:
</p>
       
<blockquote><tt>
svn co svn+ssh+userv://xapian-svn@svn.xapian.org/xapian/trunk xapian
</tt></blockquote>

</div>

<h2>Snapshots</h2>

<p>
You can download
<A HREF="http://oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/trunk/">automated snapshots</A>,
which are generated from git every 20 minutes, provided <tt>make distcheck</tt> 
passes on Linux.  This means that some breakages are avoided, but they may 
still fail to build for you if you're using a different platform, or even a
different version of Linux.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get a better idea of how healthy the tree is on various
platforms, see the
<a href="http://trac.xapian.org/wiki/AutomatedBuilds">automated builds</a>
page on the wiki.
