<center><h1>The Xapian Project</h1></center><br>
Welcome to the pages of the Xapian project.<br>

Xapian is not an application, but a library that enables developers to use
advanced information retrieval techniques in their own projects. This makes
it an attractive alternative to &quot;packaged&quot; search engines that need to be
extensively hacked in order to use it as a specialty search engine.
<p>

Features of Xapian include:
<ul>
<li> Flexible indexing of documents;
<li> Full access to the index: from term to document, but also from document to terms;
<li> Good query possibilities, including Boolean and phrase search;
<li> Advanced ranking techniques;
<li> Relevance feedback.
</ul>

The Xapian project will continue development of the Omsee search engine
library, as published under the GPL by Brightstation plc. Since
Brightstation will not continue development of Omsee under the
GPL, the Xapian project unites developers and users of the library to pursue
further development of the state-of-the-art information retrieval principles
underlying the Omsee design.<br>
A previous incarnation of this project was called Omseek, but we have been informed by Brightstation's legal
department that this was too similar to Omsee. After much deliberation, the project name was changed to
Xapian.

The original CVS tree of the Omsee project is preserved on the Xapian CVS server, though the Xapian developers have since
made many modifications. To get the lastest version of Xapian directly from our CVS, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> Log in anonymously into the CVS: <tt>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xapian.org:/cvsroot/xapian login</tt>
(Just hit return when you are asked for the password.)
<li> Check out the latest version: <tt>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xapian.org:/cvsroot/xapian co om</tt>
<li> In the newly created <tt>om</tt> directory, issue the command <tt>buildall</tt>.
</ol>

If you encounter any problems, contact the developers on the <tt>xapian-devel</tt> mailing list, or report bugs via <a href='bugs/'>the bug tracking system</a>.
